# RPT 6000 — Advanced Table Lookups & Data Internalization

The **Report 6000** application adds sophisticated COBOL "bells and whistles" to create a polished, enterprise-grade reporting tool. This program utilizes advanced data structures and memory management to process customer sales data, performing dynamic table lookups to pair sales representative IDs with their names for a comprehensive final report.

## What it does
* **Dynamic Table Lookups:** Implements a secondary data file (`SALESREP`) that is read into an internal table, allowing the program to dynamically find and display rep names by their ID.
* **Multi-Level Reporting:** Sorted by branch and representative, providing nested subtotals for a granular view of sales performance.
* **Calculated Financial Metrics:** Automatically computes Year-To-Date (YTD) change amounts and percentages, tracking growth or decline across customer accounts.
* **Robust Memory Redefinition:** Utilizes the `REDEFINES` clause to handle special cases, such as displaying "OVRFLW" or "N/A" when numeric calculations aren't possible.
* **Professional Output Formatting:** Manages complex report headers, branch totals, and sales rep totals with standardized COBOL coding syntax.

## New COBOL Concepts Implemented
Compared to previous iterations, this version introduces advanced enterprise features:
* **Table Processing & Search:** Implementation of internal tables using the `OCCURS` clause and optimized retrieval via the `SEARCH` verb and `INDEXED BY`.
* **Data Internalization (COPY Members):** Use of `COPY` statements to pull in external record definitions for `CUSTMAST` and `SALESREP`, promoting modularity and code reusability.
* **Advanced Data Types:** Implementation of `PACKED-DECIMAL` (`COMP-3`) for field definitions to optimize mainframe storage and computational performance.
* **Proactive Error Handling:** Use of the `INITIALIZE` verb for group items and `ON SIZE ERROR` logic to manage numeric overflows and division-by-zero during calculations.
* **Flexible Logic Control:** Transition to `EVALUATE TRUE` structures for more readable and robust program control compared to standard nested IF statements.

## Program Output
